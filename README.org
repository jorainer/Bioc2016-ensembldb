* Building and Using Ensembl-based Annotation Packages with =ensembldb=

This repository provides the code and slides used for the =ensembldb=
demonstration/presentation at the Bioconductor conference *BioC 2016* in Stanford.

The [[file:./Bioc2016-ensembldb.org]] is the /main/ presentation file (Emacs org-mode
file). It was exported as an /Rmd/ file and then manually edited to fix remaining
layout problems resulting in the [[file:./Bioc2016-ensembldb_edit.Rmd]] file.
