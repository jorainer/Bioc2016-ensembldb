* Building and Using Ensembl-based Annotation Packages with =ensembldb=

This repository provides the code and slides used for the =ensembldb=
demonstration/presentation at the Bioconductor conference *BioC 2016* in Stanford.

The [[file:./Bioc2016-ensembldb.org]] is the /main/ presentation file (Emacs org-mode
file). It was exported as to an Rmd file ( [[file:./Bioc2016-ensembldb.Rmd]]) as
well as into an pdf file. The /_beamer/ file represents a manually changed version
of the original /org/ file to fit the content (more or less) onto slides.
